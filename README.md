<h6>About the Team</h6>Our team is a student cohort of six that were beginners/ intermediate users of Python and html. We are now bosses at both.</p>
<h6>Data Collection</h6>We used the webscraping method to collect data for Avatar, Arthur, Adventure Time, and The Simpsons from each of their 
respective fanwiki pages.<br>We also used a data library called Kaggle to collect data for The Office, Seinfeld, Spongebob, and Futurama.</p>
<h6>Type of Model and Technical Stack</h6>We used:
- `Python` to build the model,
- Pandas for data wrangling,
- Flask for building the website,
- Beautiful Soup to get datasets from webscraping,
- and aitextgen for creating our TV show models
