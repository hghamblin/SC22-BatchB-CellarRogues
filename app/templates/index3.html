                          Because of our experience from the previous two models, it took very little time to create this one.
                           We decided that this model would be best, since there weren't any outstanding errors in our data, and there was a plethora of unique and useful data on the internet.</p></div>

                          We decided to make a HTML page for each TV show, which believe makes the user experience better. There are many aspects to our website that we believe will help the user experience, which includes the drop down menus for the main characters. This will help prevent typos and ensure that the AI can generate its best code.</p></div>
